#Preparator3000 Contributions

Preparator is a repo that is constantly being iterated on, and as such we greatly appreciate student's input. However, to ensure a consistent workflow, **we do not accept Pull Requests made to the student repo**. Instead, we use GitHub Issues to track improvements and bugs. This allows us to review and collaborate on these as a team and ensure a consistent code base.

## Bug reporting

Since Preparator3000 is being constantly worked on, it is extremely possible that some bugs will slip through. Please report these using GitHub Issues. You can access the issues for Preparator3000 via its repo page, at the top next to the "Pull Requests" tab. Please make sure to add the `Bug` label to your issue and a staff member will look into it.

We appreciate your help with this, and reported bugs help your fellow alumni!

## Contributions

Preparator is designed to test and promote building blocks. A building block is not a toy problem per se, although problems can certainly teach a building block. Rather, a building block should enforce a skill that frees you to improve on your logic.

If you believe something is missing from this repo, please make a GitHub Issue with the `Enhancement` label on it. Please clearly explain the building block that this improvement would address, and we will look at it.
